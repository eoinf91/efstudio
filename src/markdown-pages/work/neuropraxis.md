EF Studio was asked to design and develop the website for Neuropraxis. A company based in Los Angeles, California that specialises in assisting it's clients recover from major traumas in their lives. This became a special project for us as we understood the sensitivity related to the company and the passion of those working for the company. It was important to create an experience that is easy for the user to find what they need and to feel safe and relaxed while on the website.

Using the Adobe XD we created interactive mockups for the website in order to show off our designs and test them with the users. We also developed the website as a WordPress theme in order to give the company full control of their website and the ability to update content on a regular basis. Finally, we set the company up with Google Analytics and supplied an easy go-to guide to help with keeping on top of their website in the future.
