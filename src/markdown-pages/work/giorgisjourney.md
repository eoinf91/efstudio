EF Studio was asked by Giorgi's Journey to design and develop a new look and feel for her blog. This project was created while working fluidly with the client in order to capture the right feelings and portray the clients passion to the best of it's ability. The client also wanted to include an online store in the website to sell Adobe Lightroom Presets. 

The final piece captured exactly what the client was looking for. We used Adobe XD to create the design mockups for the client to get a strong idea as to what the final website would look like before it was developed. The final solution was developed using GatsbyJS along with Shopify to power the store of the site. This project also included some email automation and email design for newsletter signups.
